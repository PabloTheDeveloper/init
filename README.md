# init-me
init-me installs all needed packages for a frictionless development environment. Customized for me if ever I need to switch to another laptop or machine.

# Quickstart

## Step 1: Download the bash script
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PabloTheDeveloper/init-me/master/main.sh > tmp.sh
```

## Step 2: Execute script
```
bash tmp.sh
```

# Development Roadmap
1. Setup BATS to test bash script (using bash since most distro have it by default).
    * [x] Need to install basic packages (vim, git, gh, sway)
    * [x] Need to run basic configuration for those packages (git.configs, copy base vim file for bash edits, sway files)
