# init-me
init-me installs all needed packages for a frictionless development environment. Customized for me if ever I need to switch to another laptop or machine.

# Development Roadmap
1. Setup BATS to test bash script (using bash since most distro have it by default).
    * [ ] Need to install basic packages (vim, git, gh, sway)
    * [ ] Need to run basic commands (git.configs...,)
